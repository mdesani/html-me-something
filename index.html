<h2> ❖ Thyroid Gland - Functions & Role in Human Body</h2>
<p> The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped gland located at the lower part of the neck just below the Adam’s apple. It is one of the largest and most important endocrine glands of the body. 
    The thyroid gland is a metabolic regulator of the body and it directly controls the functioning of almost all parts of the body with major influence on heart, liver, kidney, brain, reproductive organs 
    and the gastrointestinal tract. It also regulates body temperature, body weight, as well as cholesterol levels. The thyroid gland mainly produces three hormones – thyroxine ( T4 ), triiodothyronine (T3) and calcitonin. 
    Iodine is essential for the regulation and synthesis of thyroid hormones.

<h2><span>❖ Hypothyroidism </span></h2>
<p>Hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) occurs when the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce sufficient thyroid hormones (i.e T3 and T4) to maintain normal body function. 
    This leads to an increase in the levels of thyroid -stimulating hormones (TSH) in the body, which may lead to the development of several symptoms as well as a decrease in the metabolic rate . 
    About 4.6 percent of the U.S. population age 12 and older has hypothyroidism, and  women are more likely to develop hypothyroidism compared to men.

<h3>✤ Causes & Symptoms of Hypothyroidism</h3>
<p>◉ The major causes of hypothyroidism are autoimmune disorder, congenital hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, surgical removal of part or whole of thyroid gland, exposure to radiations, some medications as well as Hashimoto’s disease. <br>

    ◉ Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, edema, menstrual irregularities, difficulty in breathing, diastolic hypertension, and intolerance to cold. Hypothyroidism in women of reproductive age can lead to menstrual irregularities, polycystic ovarian syndrome as well as infertility. 
    In pregnant women, hypothyroidism can have deleterious effects both on the mother and the fetus such as pre-eclampsia, neurodevelopmental defects in fetus, as well as abortion.</p>

<h3>✤ Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by physical examination, patient’s medical and family history, and blood tests. The primary diagnostic test is the TSH Test. 
    As per the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists the normal TSH range or TSH level in euthyroid condition is 0.3-3.0 mIU/L. 
    Other tests include Free T3 and T4 tests, thyroid antibody tests, thyroglobulin test, and radioactive iodine uptake test.
    </p>
<h3>✤ Types of Hypothyroidism</h3>
<p>Hypothyroidism is mainly graded in two subtypes: <br>

        •	Overt Hypothyroidism: It is defined as an increase in serum TSH (usually > 10mIU/L) associated with a decrease concentration of thyroxine (i.e T4).<br>

        •	Subclinical Hypothyroidism: It is defined as a condition in which there is an increase in the levels of TSH in the body while concentrations of serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) still remain normal. Subclinical hypothyroidism may progress to overt hypothyroidism in approximately 2-5% cases annually.

    <h2>❖ Regulation and Synthesis of Thyroid Hormone</h2>
    <p>
            The secretion of thyroid hormones is regulated by the hypothalamus – pituitary- thyroid axis. 
            The hypothalamus senses the circulating levels of free thyroxine (T4) and free triiodothyronine (T3) in blood through a negative feedback system. 
            If the circulating levels of T3 and T4 are low, then the hypothalamus secretes TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland to release TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). 
            TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4. <br>
            Figure 1 shows a pictorial presentation of the regulation of thyroid hormone synthesis

    <h2>❖ Treatment of Hypothyroidism</h2>
    <p>
        • Hypothyroidism cannot be cured but it can be controlled with the help of thyroxine replacement therapy. <br>
        • Synthetic thyroxine or levothyroxine is used by the majority of healthcare providers. The dose is decided based upon the patient’s weight, age, and other associated conditions such as pregnancy, infertility, cardiovascular diseases, 
          diabetes, etc. <br>
          Synthetic thyroxine or L-thyroxine needs to be taken by the patient for his/her entire life following diagnosis, with the dose adjusted at regular intervals based on TSH levels.<br>
        • The dose of synthetic thyroxine or L-thyroxine is calculated as micrograms/kg body weight/day. <br>
        • Hypothyroid patient should take the regular L-thyroxine tablet early in the morning preferably on an empty stomach. <br>
        • Also, precaution should be taken that supplements or dietary sources containing calcium or iron should be consumed only after an interval of 4 hours, as calcium and iron can interfere with the absorption of L-thyroxine from the gut.
